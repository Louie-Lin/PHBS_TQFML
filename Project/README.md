## Project Description
The turn over of employee is what the employer concern. This project is to establish a model to predict whether employees will quit from a given record of factors affecting employee turnover.
## Project process

* __Data analysis__: Do some statistical analysis on the data as well as visualize the data to get the intuitively idea that which feature may be useful to clarify these two kinds of people. For example, we can see the distribution of different features in these two kinds of people. 
*	__Data processing__: Deal with the na data. Change some categorical data into dummie variables or continuous variable.
* __Feature construction__: Try to build some new features by the raw data to describe the behavior of this person more specific.
* __Data Split__:Spilt the data into training data and test data randomly.
* __Model Training__: Use the in-sample data to train and validate the model, I may use perception, logistic regression, SVM, decision tree and combine different models for ensemble learning to improve the performance.
* __Improvement__: Try to use PCA or LDA and redo the step of __Model training__.
* __Visualization__: Do some visualization for the outcome.
* __Evaluation__: Evaluate the prediction model by confusion metric and so on.
